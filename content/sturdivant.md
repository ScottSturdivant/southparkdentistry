Dentist, wife, mother, athlete: These are just a few words to describe Dr. Heather Sturdivant.

Dr. Sturdivant is originally from Great Falls, Montana and received her DDS degree from the University of Minnesota School of Dentistry (go Gophers!) after earning an undergraduate degree in Cell Biology and Neuroscience from Montana State University. She then completed a general practice residency at Denver Health.

In her free time, Dr. Sturdivant enjoys running and traveling, opting to combine the two whenever possible. Her notable acheivements include the Leadville Trail 100 Ultramarathon, two full Ironman triathlons, and has completed a marathon in every state.

When it comes to dentistry, Dr. Sturdivant believes in a conservative and compassionate approach. She will never try to upsell a service, or make you feel that your time isn't also valuable. When you step foot into her office, you are family.
